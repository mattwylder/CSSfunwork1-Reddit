"Funwork" no. 1 for DePaul Computer Science Society: "Reddit Viewer"

My implementation isn't a viewer*, it's a command line app that allows you to log into reddit and post a
self-post to reddit.com/r/jncojeans. /r/jncojeans only because I own that subreddit and no one will be
annoyed by all of the test posts.


*there's an unused method in there for it.
